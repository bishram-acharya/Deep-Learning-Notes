# Deep Learning Notes

This repository contains my deep learning study notes and relevant visualizations. Below are some key resources:

### 1. **[Skip Connections](https://github.com/bishram-acharya/Deep-Learning-Notes/blob/main/Skip%20Connections.png)**
Learn about the role and implementation of skip connections in deep neural networks.

### 2. **[Weight Initialization](https://github.com/bishram-acharya/Deep-Learning-Notes/blob/main/Weight_initialization.png)**
This link will take you to an image illustrating different weight initialization techniques for neural networks.

### 3. **[MLP for Images](https://github.com/bishram-acharya/Deep-Learning-Notes/blob/main/mlp_for_images.png)**
Explore the use of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for image processing.

Feel free to download and/or discuss!
